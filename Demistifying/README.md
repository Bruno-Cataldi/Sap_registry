This is a list of vulnerabilities identified by the article [Demystifying Exploitable Bugs in Smart Contracts](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/zhan3299/res/ICSE23.pdf) as Machine Unauditable Bugs, or MUBs for short. Along these vulnerabilities, we propose a corresponding CWE classification as well a real-life example of an exploit.

### Privilege Escalation
Let a business flow B be a sequence of transactions t1, ..., tn, each denoting an external function invocation, and n the length of flow which may be equal to or larger than 1. Assume B has some critical  operation f guarded by a set of access control checks, denoted as P, a conjunction of multiple checks. However, there exists an (unexpected) business flow t′ 1, ... t′ m that can reach f with access control P′ and P′ < P
